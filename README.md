**Flask-Commands** is a local-first CLI tool that scaffolds Flask projects and keeps generating views, routes, controllers, and models for you so you can stay in flow. This is still very much in a beta stage, so try it out at your own risk.

## Getting Started

Flask-Commands bundles a few opinionated conveniences:

- `flask new` bootstraps a ready-to-run Flask project with virtualenv, dotenv, Tailwind wiring, and optional SQLite + migrations.
- `flask make:view` generates HTML views and can optionally add controllers, routes/blueprints, and SQLAlchemy models to match.

The goal is to remove the repetitive setup work while keeping everything local and transparent.

## Installation

Flask-Commands is designed to be installed globally so you can create new Flask apps anywhere on your machine.

```bash
pip install Flask-Commands
```

> The published console script is `flask`. If you have a clash with Flask’s own CLI, run with `python -m flask_commands.cli ...` or rename the script in `pyproject.toml`.

## Quick Start

```bash
flask new myproject          # add --no-db if you want to skip SQLite/migrations
cd myproject
source venv/bin/activate
flask run --debug            # or ./run.sh on macOS to open terminals + Tailwind watcher
```

Add a first page with controller and route wiring:

```bash
flask make:view posts.index -cr
flask make:view admin.users.show -cr   # nested example
```

Tailwind is installed automatically when `npm` is available; otherwise the tool skips it with a warning.

## Commands

### flask new

After installing Flask-Commands globally, you’ll have access to a new command called `flask`, which lets you quickly scaffold Flask applications from the terminal.

```bash
flask new myproject
```

Once the command completes, you’ll see a new directory called `myproject/` that contains everything you need to get a Flask application up and running.

What you get:

- A Python virtual environment `venv/` with core Flask dependencies pre-installed and listed in `requirements.txt`.
- When using `--db` (enabled by default unless `--no-db` is specified), the following are also included:
  - Flask-Migrate
  - Flask-SQLAlchemy
  - A seeded SQLite database with a users table
  - An initial migration already applied
- A blueprint-based application skeleton under `app/`, organized by responsibility:
  - **Model** `app/models/` defining all your application’s data models/structure along with their methods.
  - **View** `app/templates/` containing all HTML templates (including macros/components) used by the application.
  - **Controller** `app/controllers/` housing controller classes responsible for the logic to gather and serve the requested data.
  - **URL** `app/routes/` declaring URL paths and connecting them to controllers.
- The project entry point at `run.py`.
- Centralized configuration files under `config/`.
- If `npm` is installed, a Tailwind-ready static asset pipeline at `app/static/src/`, including npm scripts for watching and building CSS.
- Environment configuration files:
  - `.env`
  - `.env.example`
- A default blueprint named `mains`, defined in `app/__init__.py`:
  - Routes at `app/routes/mains`
  - A controller at `app/controllers/main_controller` named `MainController`
  - A starter “Hello World” template at `app/templates/mains/index.html`
- A macOS-friendly helper script `run.sh` for starting the application with a single command:

```bash
./run.sh
```

You can review this structure directly in the Flask-Commands source under `flask_commands/project`.

### flask make:view

Generates template files under `app/templates/` from dotted paths (for example, `posts.index` maps to `app/templates/posts/index.html`). Optional flags wire up matching components:

- `-c/--generate-controller` or `--controller NAME` creates or extends the controller class.
- `-r/--generate-route` or `--route PATH` adds blueprint routes (CRUD verbs inferred when possible).
- `-m/--generate-model` or `--model NAME` seeds a SQLAlchemy model and import stub.

Examples:

```bash
flask make:view button                    # view-only snippet
flask make:view posts.index -crm          # view + controller + route + model
flask make:view posts.show --route /posts/<int:post_id> --controller PostController
```
